An iPhone wallpaper that I made with a computer. After many attempts, it became apparent that scratching the screen with a pencil wasn't a valid method for creating digital art, so I tried using the bar of soap thing that had thick string attaching it to the computer box. Anyway, the mountains were modeled in Blender, which is free (<a href="http://www.blender.org">get it</a>). Then using a combination of Photoshop and Flash, I added the sky and reflection. If you enjoy this wallpaper, remember to rate it 5 stars somehow. Just click on it really hard and I'll be notified eventually.

I was contacted through a connection of a connection of mine to design a logo for an eminently launching company, so after negotiating the terms of my contract I accepted the job. With a wry smile on my face and a devious twinkle in my eye, I reached back and removed the satchel resting on my shoulder. I slid it across the table, and before it could come to a stop, heaps of dough were poured in by my client's associates. All the while, I refused to break eye contact with the figure across from me who was almost completely silhouetted save for the weary, cautious white ellipses that served for eyes&hellip; Uh, anyway, my mom's friend asked me to make a logo, so I did.

I e-mailed this to the developer of a video server app for iOS (prior to VLC's port). I got a response in pigeon English about not wanting to confuse customers and "brand recognition". His current icon was a generic, vaguely metallic play button over a circle. Woo. In fairness, this wouldn't really do much to set his app apart.

I'm in love with Adobe Flash CS6, so as a symbol for my love, I made it this icon. It dumped me.

A small comparison showing Apple's current iOS Photos icon and a minor tweak that I think slightly improves it. Possibly you disagree.

I had a minor fling with Adobe Premiere after having my heart broken by Flash. This was one attempt to ingratiate myself with Premiere. Ultimately, I realized I was just using the program as a distraction from my undying love of Flash.
