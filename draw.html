<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/angerdanger.jpg'><img src="drawings/angerdanger.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
The AngerDanger himself&#8212;er, <i>my</i>self. Yes. Anyway, the reason I look utterly pissed is because my head looked smushed and that caused a great deal of pain. Look at the picture again. See? Smoooshed. Oh, and the medium was charcoal and a type of paper called Bristol, like the place but paper.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/muth.jpeg'><img src="drawings/muth.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Fun fact: <a onmouseover="hover(event)" onmouseout="leave()">Ellen Muth doesn't look like a bloody alien in real life.</a> She is rather pretty, actually, so I drew her and then this happened and I'm so sorry.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/sad.jpeg'><img src="drawings/sad.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
A drawing of a person who wasn't actually on the verge of tears.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/pinky.jpeg'><img src="drawings/pinky.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
A drawing of a friend who doesn't actually have lopsided eyes.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/sleepy.jpeg'><img src="drawings/sleepy.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
She kept moving around and blinking her eyes, so I drew her with her eyes closed. That'll&hellip; teach her!
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/corpse.jpeg'><img src="drawings/corpse.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Now she's lying dead on the floor, or so one would think from the way she was drawn. It's as if this "artist" isn't particularly talented.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/cow.jpeg'><img src="drawings/cow.jpeg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
A drawing of a person who isn't actually a gormless cow.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/chell.jpg'><img src="drawings/chell.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Another drawing of CowGirl in which she looks more like Chell from the Portal series. It's definitely an improvement from before but still doesn't even approach realism. 
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/tmba.jpg'><img src="drawings/tmba.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! AHHHHHHHHHHH&#8212;OH GOD MAKE IT STOP! NO NO NO NO NO NO MAKEITSTOPMAKEITSTOPMAKEITSTOPMAKEITSTOP!
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/cloth.jpg'><img src="drawings/cloth.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Boring drawing featuring stuff and things. I like the way the one thing looks like it's resting on or existing near the other one that is also near by. 
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/conatainers.jpg'><img src="drawings/containers.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Fun fact: each item in this picture was originally designed to hold some sort of stuff, but their original purposes have been all but obfuscated for the sake of art! Ahahahahahahaha!
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/skate.jpg'><img src="drawings/skate.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Despite this picture's filename being 'skate.JPG', it actually features other objects besides a skate. I'm deeply sorry if anybody is offended by my abhorrent oversight.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/double.jpg'><img src="drawings/double.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
I decided to defy convention by including a door in this drawing. Not many drawings feature doors, heaters, spaces, etc. I'm challenging normative ideals. 
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/bottleoranges.jpg'><img src="drawings/bottleoranges.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
My mouthwateringly decadent lunch.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/tape.jpg'><img src="drawings/tape.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
This is pretty damn mundane even for me.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/collection.jpg'><img src="drawings/collection.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
More things. When I look at this picture, I always get the vague sense that I'm getting a vague sense from this picture I'm looking at.
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/tapeorangespeaker.jpg'><img src="drawings/tapeorangespeaker.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
Finally, we're almost done with this uninspired mess!
</div>

<div class="chamber"><center><a href='drawings/structure.jpg'><img src="drawings/structure.jpg" width="580px"></a></center><p>
YES! Done! Over! If you've made it this far, I'd like you to take a moment and imagine how nice it would've been if you were looking at <i>good</i> art by a <i>talented</i> person. Ahhhh&hellip; isn't that good? Everything is all better now.
